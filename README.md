# Trading Performance Query (TPQ) - ReDi Final Project 

Why this project:
* to deal with data (numbers);
* to use programming language python;
* to the functions I learned during the courses: loops, decision-making, def functions and arithmetic operation;
* to do something realistic

What does Trading Performance Query (TRQ) do:
* to save transactions in separate file according to buy or sell;
* to do single stock performance query, including listing all historical transactions of this single stock and calculate the performance (win/loss) in percentage;
* to use a current sell price to calculate the current single stock performance 


What function could be upgraded in the future:
* to do the stock query for the whole portfolio performance;
* to show the results on a GUI window
